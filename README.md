# ESG-Carbon-Contracts

The proposal defines a standardized, ACTUS-compliant framework for modeling carbon-related financial instruments—such as carbon spot trades, futures, offsets, swaps, insurance, and emission-linked finance—using existing ACTUS contract types, and potential enhancements. The central premise of the framework is that carbon footprint represents the underlying economic quantity, while footprint-related metrics function as  risk factors that influence financial outcomes. This approach relies on mapping carbon use cases to existing ACTUS contract types such as PAM, ANN, FUTUR, and compositional structures. Carbon-related contracts are  standardized  with references and risk factors, ensuring financial consistency, auditability, and interoperability across systems. For example, in emission-linked finance, a loan footprint index would show a better financial rate when the borrower demonstrates lower verified emissions intensity relative to an agreed baseline. A similar structure applies to carbon offset contracts. An offset footprint index would determine settlement outcomes when the offset project demonstrates verified emission reductions relative to the contracted baseline. In carbon swap arrangements, a footprint index would generate favorable cash flows for the lower-emission counterparty when actual verified emissions fall below the agreed reference baseline. Insurance products linked to carbon performance can also be represented within this framework. From a regulatory and audit perspective, ACTUS-based representations improve transparency and consistency. Cash flows are generated according to explicit rules, making it easier to analyze contractual obligations under different scenarios. This aligns with emerging climate-related financial disclosure requirements, which emphasize traceability, consistency, and comparability of climate-related financial exposures.
